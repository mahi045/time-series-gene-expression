\section{Conclution}
In this work, we have proposed and investigated different methods of anomaly
detection and forecasting of time series gene expression. Anomaly and forecasting have various application for gene expression analysis such as predicting the missing values from time series, noise removal, cell cycle determination, gene clustering based on anomaly. To verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of these methods, we conduct an extensive experimental study
on three real gene expression datasets. Since no prior works have been done in this field of gene expression analysis, we have to rely on traditional machine learning and statistical methods for forecasting and anomaly detection
and compare their performance. We hope that this research
outcome would provide a great deal of importance and open new field of
opportunity of thinking and utilizing time series gene expression in a new
level.

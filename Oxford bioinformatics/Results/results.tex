\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:exp}

We run various experiments on different methods of anomaly detection and  forecasting over three real datasets. Distinct performance metrics are used in different methods. 
In this section we briefly describe the datasets used and experimental setup for perfomance analysis on the approaches as discussed in previous sections.

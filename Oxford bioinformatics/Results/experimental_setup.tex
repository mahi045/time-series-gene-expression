\subsection{Environment Setup}
All of our experiments are implemented in Python. Moreover, we use external packages and library for various methods. For example, Anompy\footnote{\url{https://github.com/takuti/anompy}} has been used for statistical method to fit the time series and mark individual points as anomalous or normal. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning based models for anomaly detection have been implemented with Python machine learning packages scikit-learn\footnote{\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/}}.

We use Statsmodels\footnote{\url{http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html}} for ARIMA model in forecasting. For deep-learning based LSTM and Neural Network method, we use Python Deep Learning library Keras\footnote{\url{https://keras.io/}} using Tensorflow\footnote{\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/}} as backend.
